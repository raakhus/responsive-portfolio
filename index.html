                <img id="photo" src="assets/images/20161112_144747.jpg" alt="randy aakhus"> I grew up in Bakersfield, California. When I was young, I had extreme flexibility in my joints (still do
                for some joints). My overprotective Mother decided I should not be allowed to play contact sports. For the
                better part of my young, life I developed my skills at swimming and learning.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Swimming and school provided the opportunity to leave my hometown. I went to college at the University of California,
                Santa Barbara. While attending UCSB, I qualified for the Olympic Trials, graduated with a degree in Economics,
                and added 30 years of age to my liver.</p>
            <br>
            <p>After graduating, I became an Ocean Lifeguard with Long Beach Fire Department. This made me realize I did not
                want to be a Lifeguard or any other type of public saftey employee. After the summer, I talked to my brother
                and we started our own corporation called ACTS Services.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The service we provided was to install solar panels on the roof of houses. Some time passed and I realized this
                daily grind wasn't for me.</p>
            <br>


            <p>Now I'm in this class figuring out how to build this webpage.</p>
